Visual studio.net:
 Solution-----one or more project----------------Build----------------Binary executable files
		source code (.cs files)-----   (compile + bundled)----
		Console Application-----------csc.exe----------------- .exe file  or .dll files
				c# Code-------C# compiler----------------IL code
.Net Framework:
		 a runtime
		 CLR :Common Language Runtime (.net exeuction engine)
		 CTS :Common Type System 
				Value types :primitive types:
						int, float, double, boolean, char
					     user defined types:
						enum,struct
						
				Reference types:
						class ,interface,
						delegate, event

				FCL:Framework Class Library (.dll's)
					(Dynamic Link Library)
		    CLS
		Divide and Rule
	What is the difference between exe and dll
		exe----Self executable application image
		DLL----Dependency executable reusable library



	 .net framework
	 CLR:Execution Engine (Common Language Runtime)
		Assembly loader,
		code verifier
		JIT (converting IL code into native code)
		GC  (automatic memory management of HEAP)
			(Mark and Sweep algorithm)

	 CTS:Common Type System
		 Value types and reference types
		 FCL: inbuilt dll's
			system.dll
			catalog.dll
			mysql.data.dll

		 Assemblies:
			Assembly: a logical unit of deployment on .net platform
				consist of  IL Code

	 exe and DLL
	  namespaces
         
	  primitive types
	  user defined types: class, structure
	  Application execution memory: heap and stack
	  Heap is managed by Garbage Collector ( is a part of CLR)

		 ILDASM:Intermediate Language Disassembler



	 Using Visual studio
		Solution Builder creates empty solution
				Solution consits one or more projects
					Console Application
					Class Library 

		Solution builer after writing code Builds Solution
				Compiler converts C# code into IL code
				IL code is bundled into assembly  (exe or dll)
				DLL or exe contains IL code

		Application is submitted to Execute by run option

			Exe is submitted to OS for execution
			OS will create a Process (instance or running application)
				OS will assign primary thread to the process
				Primary thread will read manifest of assemly and 
					loads CLR into process
					within Process APPlication Domain is created 
					 within application domain IL is loaded by 
							Assembly loader of CLR
					 Primary Thread invokes Entry Point Main function
