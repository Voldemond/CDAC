Aptitude will be there in our cc exam 
40 question will be there mostly 

30 to 45 sec good for aptitude per minute 

Roadmap || approach 

speed (30 to 40 sec ) easy 
medium ( 1 to 2 min ) 
hard (10 to 15 min ) hard  

accuracy

attempt all the questions of aptitude  

OS 
what is os 
how does it works 


Examples of well knowon OS : 
Mobile os : Android , IOS , windows 
Embedded SYstem os : smart watch , 
Real Time OS ; HRT , SRT ( hard real time , Soft real time )

HRT (not even a nano second of delay is accepted ) 
SRT ( some nano second of delay is accepted ) 

Desktop OS ; Personal COmputer 

windows os ; dot net core 
android os ; java swing 

server machine os ; 

linux ; it is a open source (we can adopt that code ) 
boss ( bharat operating system ) one of the unix distribution

linux comes with cmd + gui 

Function of OS ; 
	- Process management 
whatever there is a process it is a process management 

	- Memory Management (physical memory (ram)) 

	- Device Management 

	- Network Management (Network card / Controller ) 

	- File Management 

	- Security Management (firewall , Anti virus , anti spyware )
	

what is interrupt and what is system call 

Data segment  : Stack HEap 

Code segment  : 

Memory Hierarchy 

primary - ROM (PROM , EPROM , EEPROM ) , Ram (SRAM , DRAM ) 

Secondary - HDD , magnetic Disk , USB pendrive , optical drives , CD's , Floppy 


REGISTER 
CACHE 
RAM 
HDD 
EXTERNAL DEVICES 

Hierarchy in speed and cost is rising towards register but rising  
in repect to space towards external devices 

the data in REgister , cache and ram are volatile 
but rom , hdd and other are non volatile 

Types of Operating systems 

1. Batch Operating SYstem 
2. Multi- programming os 
3. Mutiprocessor OS 
4. DIstributed OS 
5. Desktop OS 
6. Server os 

Multi processing system 
what is degree of parallelism 

Distributed OS 



***Linux***

it is an open source operating system . 
it is available free to use and user can modify it according their needs . 
- The founder or Linux is linun Torvards .
- IT is available since 1991. 
- An Open Source community is working behind the updation and upgradation of the Linux code. 
- Features . 
	1. No cost / Low cost 
	2. Multi-Tasking 
	3. Security 
	4. Multi-user 
	5. Stable and Scalable 
	6. Networking 
	7. CLI as well as GUI 
	8. Better file System 

-Working with basics file system of Linux 
- / is root directory 
	1. / bin : user Bineries 
	2. / sbin : System Bineries 
	3. / etc : Configuration Files 
	4. / dev : device files 
	5. / proc : Process Information
	6. / var : Varialbes Files 
	7. / tmp : Temporary FIles 
	8. / usr : User Programs 
	9. / home : Parent Directory of User friendly 
	10. / boot : Boot Loader Files 
	11. / opt : Apps 
	12. / lib : System Libraries 
 
COmmands : 
1. " nano " : creates the files : it actually run the nano editor and open the specified file . 
// if nano doesn't find the file it creates the file 
2. ls : it list out all the files and directory 
3. touch : to create the file // only to create the file 
4. mkdir : "folder name " to create the folder 
5. ls -l : gives file permission , owner , sub user , file name , date , time and size 
6. chmod : to give and revoke the file or directories permission. 
7. rm : remove files rm -r "dir file name " 
rmdir : to remove 
8. pwd : to know the directory we are currently in 
present working directory 
9. cd : to change directory 


r- Read 
W- write 
x- Execute 
d- directory 
- - file 
u - owner 
g - group 
a - all users 

white colour its a file 
blue colour its a directory 

drwx-rwx-rwx 
owner -- group --- other (file position )
 
chmod to define whom to give what permissions 
" chmod u+x file1.txt " 

### to remove a parent directory we need to kill sub

remaining piping concept

ls commands options find out ? for eg ls -l 
DMA (direct memory access )
